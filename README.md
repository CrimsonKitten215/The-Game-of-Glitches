WARNING:
There is bad language in this so if you use school wifi, hahaha die!
Also, there are some stupid jokes in there. Ignore those - they were probably made by one of my friends who shall not be named.
Finally, if you see something that looks like what an insane person would write, that's for the character
(the narrator is canonically a sadist and the players for act 1 and act 2-3 are canonically sociopaths).

CREDITS (There are no credits, so here's some cool games I took inspiration from):
Kyle is Famous
The Stanley Parable
Detroit: Become Human
Slay the Princess
Doki Doki Literature Club
Dayshift at Freddy's 1-3 (A fangame but a really really good one)
Sonic.exe Nightmare Beginning (Another fangame - DO NOT SEARCH THIS ONE UP!)
